      <u>About</u>
      <p>
        This website is about everything afrobeat related. The songs, artists,
        history and all the original kings and queens who started afrobeats.
        Many people seem to forget that burnaboy, wizkid and tems arent the only
        afropop artists around. The reason they are most well known is because
        the western populaton has adapted their songs and therefore broadcasted
        it. There are many other afrobeat artists that have been ruling the
        music industry in africa for a long time, the purpose of this website is
        to recognize those artists and give them the recognition they deserve.
        My website is strictly for afro beat and nothing more,afrobeats are full
        of vibes and different beats. They arent all the same and they do come
        in different forms and can most definetly fit into other genres.
      </p>

      <u>Goal</u>
      <p>
        The goal of my webste is for more people to recognize afrobeats and
        branch out of the current afrobeat artists they listen too. Explore more
        artists and experience new music because i guarantee you there are many
        other underrated afrobeat artists out there better than the ones that we
        have today.
